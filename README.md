# Synopsis
---
This was my first ever GitHub repo. This repo was created when I decided to take the plung of making a career switch and get on the difficult path of becoming a software developer.

Below are my original words for this repo.

> learning how to use this software
> I hope to learn how to program to land a job I am really excited for
> It will be the beginning of my career in tech
