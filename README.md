# hello-world

### Synopsis
---
This was my first ever GitHub repo. This repo was created when I decided to take the plung of making a career switch and get on the difficult path of becoming a software developer.

Below are my original words for this repo.

> learning how to use this software<br/> 
> I hope to learn how to program to land a job I am really excited for<br/>
> It will be the beginning of my career in tech

Since writing those words I am well on my way to fulfilling those goals.
